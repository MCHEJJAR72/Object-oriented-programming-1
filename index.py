Step 1: Define the Class Structure
We'll start by defining a class RentalProperty that encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods for our calculator.

class RentalProperty:
    def __init__(self, property_value, monthly_rent, additional_income, operating_expenses):
        self.property_value = property_value
        self.monthly_rent = monthly_rent
        self.additional_income = additional_income
        self.operating_expenses = operating_expenses
    
    def calculate_annual_income(self):
        return (self.monthly_rent * 12) + self.additional_income
    
    def calculate_annual_expenses(self):
        return self.operating_expenses * 12
    
    def calculate_roi(self):
        annual_income = self.calculate_annual_income()
        annual_expenses = self.calculate_annual_expenses()
        
        if annual_expenses == 0:
            return "Cannot calculate ROI. Expenses are zero."
        
        roi_ratio = (annual_income - annual_expenses) / self.property_value
        roi_percentage = roi_ratio * 100
         return roi_percentage
    
Step 2: Implement the Constructor (__init__)
The constructor initializes the rental property object with the provided parameters:

property_value: Total value of the property.
monthly_rent: Monthly rental income.
additional_income: Any additional income sources (e.g., parking fees, laundry income).
operating_expenses: Total annual operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, property taxes).
Step 3: Define Calculation Methods
calculate_annual_income: Computes the total annual income from the property.
calculate_annual_expenses: Computes the total annual operating expenses.
calculate_roi: Calculates the Return on Investment (ROI) percentage based on the formula:

ROI=(Annual Income−Annual ExpensesProperty Value)×100
ROI=( Property Value Annual Income−Annual Expenses)×100
     
Step 4: Example Usage
Let's create an instance of RentalProperty and calculate the ROI:

# Example usage
property_value = 250000   # Example property value in dollars
monthly_rent = 1500       # Example monthly rent in dollars
additional_income = 200   # Example additional income per month in dollars
operating_expenses = 500  # Example annual operating expenses in dollars

property1 = RentalProperty(property_value, monthly_rent, additional_income, operating_expenses)

roi_percentage = property1.calculate_roi()
print(f"ROI for the property is: {roi_percentage:.2f}%")
Explanation:
We initialize property1 with example values for property_value, monthly_rent, additional_income, and operating_expenses.
We then calculate the ROI using property1.calculate_roi() and print the result.
Additional Considerations:
Error Handling: Ensure robust error handling, such as checking for zero expenses to avoid division by zero.
Enhancements: You can add more methods or attributes as needed, such as methods to calculate cash flow or cap rate.
Input Validation: Depending on your application, consider validating inputs to ensure they are reasonable (e.g., positive values).
